# Stable-Diffusion
### Overview
Welcome to the Stable Diffusion PyTorch repository! This project leverages the power of PyTorch to implement the Stable Diffusion model, enabling high-quality image generation from textual descriptions. Built with efficiency and scalability in mind, our implementation supports various customizations and advanced features, making it suitable for both research and practical applications.

### Features
- High-quality image generation with Stable Diffusion
- Support for custom prompts and image editing
- Efficient PyTorch implementation optimized for GPU acceleration
- Extensible architecture for further customization and research
- 
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or newer
- PyTorch 1.8 or newer
- CUDA Toolkit (for GPU acceleration)
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
### Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

`
git clone https://github.com/Ionio-io/Stable-diffusion-PyTorch.git
cd Stable-diffusion-PyTorch
`
#### Install the required Python packages:

`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`
#### Usage
To generate images with Stable Diffusion, use the following command:

`
python generate.py --prompt "A text description of the image you want to generate"
`
Advanced Options
--uncond_prompt: Specify an unconditional prompt for more abstract generations.
--strength: Control the influence of the conditional prompt on the generated image.
--n_inference_steps: Specify the number of diffusion steps.
Refer to pipeline.py for more details and options.

### Customization
This implementation allows for easy customization and extension. You can modify the generation parameters, integrate new models, or experiment with different diffusion techniques by editing the corresponding Python scripts.
